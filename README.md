# TicTacToe
-------------
Finally a decent version of my game is ready to go free in the world wide web.
After 3 weeks of classes on HTML, CSS, JS and JQuery this is the product of my achievements.

It was hard. Tic tac toe maybe can look like something very easy, ok, now I now, it isn't! Not for a newbie like me!

I often literally spent hours on a little piece of code to just change idea and approach at the end (I had a lot of horrible ideas at the start). But I still learned a lot from my little failures..I think it is a great way of learning, but I also asked for help, DT and Kasun(my teachers) are great(thanks)!

Technologies used
-----------------
I used all the technologies learned during this weeks: HTML, CSS, JS and JQuery.
I wish I had more time to adjust my code. I know that a lot of lines can be summarised in just few functions or leaner code. I will do it. I just need time.
I realised I'm really slow, I can spend hours browsing around the web for answers and people with the same problem (at this point I have to thank www.stackoverflow.com, all the problem makers like me and, especially, all the people with an answer. A good answer :) ).

The approach taken
------------------
I started writing (paper and pen) and drawing my project. I started with an idea too ambitious (time, I didn't realise how much time it would take that with my skills were a really bad combination). The first idea was a Tic-tac-toe played with the face of players. It was too much. I spend 2 hours trying to find a solution for taking a picture...(ok, please don't tell me there is a very simple way...) so I changed my plans:

The first idea, a personalised game, was still there. I decided to combine a retro style (which I love) with one of my passion, music. Last year few cool singer died so I decided to celebrate them. You can play with their pretty faces and have a nice surprise at the end (I won't spoil it now!).

Unsolved problems and improvements
----------------------------------
I have to do a lot of work on this project.
The music stops at the end of the song or if the page is refreshed. I need to put a button or some "event listener". I will do it.
I want add "it's your turn" or an arrow to indicate it and let the player choose the size of the grid.
I want to add a counter for the wins.
I want adjust the screen to play on mobile (at the moment is pretty much static. It's very static. Not flexible at all).

So.....Have fun!
